# Normal Distribution

## Overview of Normal Distribution

### Properties

* symmetric bell-shaped curve
* mean = median = mode \(in the center of the distribution\)
* the area under normal distribution = 1 \(100%\)
* the area under normal distribution, within: - 1 standard deviation $$1\sigma$$ : 68%      $$P(\mu-\sigma \le X \le \mu+\sigma) = 0.6827$$  - 2 standard deviation $$2\sigma$$ : 95%      $$P(\mu-2\sigma \le X \le \mu+2\sigma)=0.9545$$   - 3 standard deviation $$3\sigma$$ : 99.7%   $$P(\mu-3\sigma \le X \le \mu+3\sigma)=0.9973$$

### Mathematical Formula & Notation

General form of the probability density function\(PDF\) of normal distribution:

$$f(x)=\dfrac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}$$ 

* $$\mu$$: the mean of the distribution, also the expectation $$E(x)$$ , mode and median of the distribution
* $$\sigma^2$$: the variance of the distribution $$Var(x)$$ 
* $$\sigma$$ : the standard deviation of the distribution
* $$\pi = 3.1416$$ 
* $$e = 2.71828$$ 

For a random variable $$X$$, which distributed normally with mean $$\mu$$ and variance  $$\sigma^2$$   
- Notation: $$X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$   
\(As the shape and location of the Normal Distribution is decided by its $$\mu$$ and $$\sigma^2$$\)

## Standard Normal Distribution

Standard Normal Distribution:   
Normal distribution with mean = 0, standard devaition = 1 \( $$\mu=0 , \sigma=1$$ \)
